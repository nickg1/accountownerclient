This is a React client application that consumes a REST API implemented on a .NET Core Web API server. It is deployed on GitHub Pages at https://nickg1.github.io/.
- Used React Router and Bootstrap to implement a navigation component.
- Used Axios for API calls to handle GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls.
- Used Redux with repository actions and reducers.
- Implemented a lazy loading Higher Order Component (HOC) to load components asynchronously.
- Centralized error handling using the Redux workflow.
- Created reusable modal window components using Bootstrap.
- Created a configuration object to dynamically generate our forms.
